## Overview
This is a task done during my Masters Degree in Data Science, where I develop several linear models using R and also perform advanced data analysis analyzing residuals, statistics and errors

## Basic tasks
These include:
* Exploratory data analysis
* Analysis of existing linear relationship between variables
* Estimation of a simple linear regresion model between variables
* Interpretation of the outcome of the model

## Mid tasks
These include:
* Fit the best possible multiple linear regression model with that set of variables.
* Compare its metrics and perform the diagnosis of the chosen linear regression model.
* Interpret the coefficients of the chosen linear regression model.
* Decompose the fitted values and residuals of the chosen linear regression model.
* Evaluate and interpret the goodness of fit of the chosen linear regression model ($R^2$ and $R^2_{adj}$).
* Evaluate and interpret the individual significance test of the chosen linear regression model.
* Evaluate and interpret the global significance test of the chosen linear regression model.
* Evaluate and interpret multicollinearity (existence of a linear relationship between the independent variables in the model) using the correlation matrix.
